    <h1>Git</h1>
    <p>Git is a seriously weird seeming way to save files, but after a while I saw how intuitive it was. Being able to collaborate on a project together without messing with each other's work, being able to roll back the development so you can fix bugs caused by later additions. <br>It really is quite cool.</p>
